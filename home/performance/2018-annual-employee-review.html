    <p class="lead">Introduction</p>
    <p>Developing a result-oriented performance culture is critical to successfully achieving organisational goals and objectives. One tool managers can use to develop results-oriented performance cultures is their appraisal programs. Appraisal programs provide a formal process for communicating organisational goals and individual performance expectations, promoting accountability for achieving those goals, identifying developmental needs, assessing performance using appropriate measures, improving individual and organisational performance, and using the results of the appraisal as a basis for appropriate personnel actions. Effective appraisal programs are fair, credible, and transparent by providing for the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alignment</strong>. Employee performance plans align with and are designed to support organizational goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Results-focus</strong>. Employee performance plans hold employees accountable for achieving results appropriate to their level of responsibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Credible Measures</strong>. Employee performance plans provide for balance, so that in addition to measuring expected results, the performance plans include appropriate measures, such as quality, quantity, timeliness, and/or cost-effectiveness, wizard-indicators of competencies, and customer perspective. In addition, for managers and supervisors, performance plans should also incorporate employee perspective.</li>
      <li><strong>Distinctions in levels of performance</strong>. The appraisal program provides for multiple levels to appraise performance and rating officials use those levels to clearly describe distinctive levels of performance and appropriately rate employee performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Consequences</strong>. The result of appraisal is used for recognizing top performers and addressing poor performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Employee Involvement</strong>. Employees are involved in the design of the appraisal program and in the development of their performance plans.</li>
      Feedback and Dialogue. The appraisal program establishes a performance feedback process that ensures a dialogue between supervisors, managers, and employees throughout the year.</li>
      <li><strong>Training</strong>. The appraisal program requires that executives, managers, supervisors, and employees receive adequate training and retraining on the performance appraisal program. In addition, supervisors must have the competencies necessary for managing performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lead">Instructions</p>
    <p>Consider the employeeâ€™s performance in each category and designate the level of performance that most accurately describes his/her job performance....</p>

    <p class="lead">Key Performance Indicators</p>
    <p>Key performance indicators apply both at the organisational and individual levels. At an organisational level, a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a quantifiable metric that reflects how well an organisation is achieving its stated goals and objectives. This is the critical link between employee performance and organisational success.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>KPIs are used to monitor the performance of a company, department, process or even an individual machine. They will also help shape the behaviours of employees within the company.</li>
      <li>KPIs need to be flexible and reflect the changing goals of the organisation. Goals change as the organisation changes in reaction to external factors or as it gets closer to achieving its original goals.</li>
      <li>Individual KPIs need to be directly linked to organisation goals and objectives, or overall organisation KPIs where they are used.</li>
      <li>They need to reflect organisation culture and values, by indicating the types of behaviour and performance the organisation will recognise as "successful" and reward employees for.</li>
      <li>KPIs need to be measurable and reflect a balance between operational and people orientated measures.</li>
    </ul>
